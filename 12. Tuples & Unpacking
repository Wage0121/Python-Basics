#Tuples are static data that cant be changed i.e. in brackets such as coordinates
#Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
#Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
#A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

# Define coordinates as a tuple
point = (3, 4)

# Accessing individual elements
x = point[0]
y = point[1]

print("X-coordinate:", x)  # Output: 3
print("Y-coordinate:", y)  # Output: 4

# Iterating over coordinates
for coordinate in point:
    print(coordinate)

# Tuple unpacking to retrieve individual coordinates
x, y = point
print("X-coordinate:", x)  # Output: 3
print("Y-coordinate:", y)  # Output: 4

#Unpacking simplifies tuples and lists
