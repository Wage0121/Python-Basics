1. A package in Python is simply a directory that contains Python modules and an additional __init__.py file. The __init__.py file can be empty or contain initialization code for the package.
2. To create a package, you need to create a directory with a name representing your package, and inside that directory, you can create Python modules (.py files) and the __init__.py file.

my_package/
├── __init__.py
├── module1.py
└── module2.py

3. Once you have created a package, you can import modules from it using dot notation.

# Importing a module from a package
import my_package.module1

# Using a function from the imported module
my_package.module1.some_function()

                                                                                                                              Example 2
#Shipping.py file
def calc_shipping():
  print("Shipping is being calculated")

#App.py
from ecommerce import shipping
shipping.calc_shipping.
